# Flask-API

This project is a simple RESTful API built using Flask that performs basic user management operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). It uses an in-memory dictionary to store user data and supports standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). The API is ideal for understanding the fundamentals of REST architecture and Flask endpoints, and can be easily extended to use a database or include authentication.
